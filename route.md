### Our route

This is roughly our route, going down south:

![Route](/assets/img/route.jpg)

#### Starting point
We'll be shipping the bikes to Malaga, and start our trip from there. We initially planned to start in Amsterdam, but decided to skip crossing Belgium/France/Spain and focus on Africa. It's already a long ride anyway and it will save us a lot of time. 

The ferry in Algeciras will take us to Tanger-Med, from where we will start following the coast down south.

#### End point

If everything goes according to plan, we'll be arriving in Cape Town end of February. We plan to ship the bikes back in a container from there.
