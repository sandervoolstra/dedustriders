### Our route

This is roughly our route, going down south:

![Route](/assets/img/route.jpg)

#### Starting point
We'll be shipping the bikes to Malaga, and start our trip from there. We initially planned to start in Amsterdam, but decided to skip Belgium/France/Spain and just focus on Africa. October can already be quite cold/wet in this part of Europe, plus we've already been there often and it will save us some time.

A ferry in Algeciras will take us to Morocco (Tanger-Med). From where we'll be following the coast down south.

#### End point

If everything goes according to plan, we'll be arriving in Cape Town end of February. We plan to ship the bikes back in a container from there.
